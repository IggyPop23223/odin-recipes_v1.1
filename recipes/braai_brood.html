    <h1>This is a Braai Brood Recipe</h1>
    <p>
        The braaibroodjie is the highlight of many a braai. Those not yet emancipated by the fact that you don’t need meat at every braai, frequently braai meat as a pretext when all they actually want is braaibroodjies. 
        This recipe is the traditional way to build a braaibroodjie; you could also refer to it as the ‘original’.

        <ul>
            <li>Get yourself a beer and tell your wife that you are going to start the fire. It is of utmost importance to inform your wife when you are going to start this step as this will ensure that the outside and inside cooking rituals are in sync. Not only is it important to tell her when you are going to start the fire but also what type of braai fuel you will be using i.e. Wood, Charcoal, Briquettes or Gas (Only use gas on days where there is a Total Fire Ban!). They all have different burning times! It is also good to check-in with your wife about 10 minutes before the coals are ready to check if she is finished preparing the braaibroodjies and if she took the meat out of the deep freeze. If not, add more braai fuel and get more beers!</li>
            <li>Spread one side of each slice of bread with butter. 
                Place half the slices buttered side down on a cutting board or bbq grid. Add cheese, tomato, onion, salt and pepper. 
                Top each sandwich with the other slice of bread with the butter on the outside. The butter will give the toasty a nice golden brown colour. 
        </li>
            <li>Optional: Add Mrs Balls Chutney</li>
            <li>Add the Braaibroodjies in a grid that can close. The OZ Braai Camp Braai grid can Braai 6 braaibroodjies at a time.</li>
            <li>Braai over mild coals, regularly turning the grid until both sides of the toasty is golden brown and the cheese melted. 
                Be mindful as it only takes two sips of beer to burn your toasties.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately as a side with your Braai'd / BBQ'd meat.</li>
        </ul>
